# Introduction

Biomedical waste or hospital waste is any kind of waste containing infectious (or potentially infectious) materials. It may also include waste associated with the        generation of biomedical waste that visually appears to be of medical or laboratory origin as well research laboratory waste containing bio molecules or organisms that are mainly restricted from environmental release.
Biomedical waste is distinct from normal trash or general waste, and differs from other types of hazardous waste, such as chemical, radioactive, universal or industrial waste. Medical facilities generate waste hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. While such wastes are normally not infectious, they require proper disposal. Some wastes are considered multi-hazardous, such as tissue samples preserved in formalin.
->Every year an estimated 16 billion injections are administered worldwide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed of afterwards.
->Open burning and incineration of health care wastes can, under some circumstances, result in the emission of dioxins, furans, and particulate matter.
->Measures to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of health care wastes can prevent adverse health and environmental impacts from such waste thus protecting the health of patients, health workers, and the general public.

->The average quantity of COVID 19 related biomedical waste generation during May, 2021 has spiked to 230 tons per day.
->The exponential rise of biomedical waste has made the process of waste management very challenging and difficult.
->What wee need is a smart system that can manage the waste around us.
->We are addressing the problem of medical waste which is generated in huge amount in our environment. Specifically, in this pandemic situation a lot of medical waste is generated like injections, PPE kits and many more. It comprises of huge amount of plastic which is dumped off in the surroundings without any management. 
->In order to manage this problem of medical waste we need a digital and effective solution to this.

# Solution

1. Our solution is a bi-ended solution i.e, it has both hardware as well as software solution.
2. We can install thermal camera over the traffic signals on the streets and the camera will pick the data from the streets and immediately send it to the cloud where      automatically Open CV modal will run. Now the NGOs and the general public can login to our app and make use of it to its fullest.
3. So basically,this camera detection and pushing notification to the NGOs through the app works as the alarming signal that there is some amount of waste over the          streets which need to be looked after and tackled ..
4. The present situation is that we as normal public see waste or garbage over the streets but we donot know where to  notify it or what to do.So we are here with a        solution which tackles this problem as well. We can just simply record or capture the vedio and directly send it to the NGOs. At backened it will automatically detect    which type of waste it is or where the waste is found and will inform the NGOs in concern.
5. Also we add an additional feature of GPS tracker and we integrate it through Google maps.
6. The user will upload a photograph or the receiver adds a photo and also the thermal camera provides photo of the garbage dumped area.All this acts as the data and        Google map reflects this data.
7. And then the NGOs just need to install our app,login to it and open it whenever they find a notification about the dumped waste complain and then simply it will show    the map and take them towards the concerned area easily.
